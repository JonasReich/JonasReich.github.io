					Hi,<br>
					<br> I’m a German game design student from Munich. I’ve been studying since summer 2015. Since then I had a shot at
					every aspect of game-making there is. Game design, programming, drawing, modeling, compositing, you name it…<br> It
					took me quite a while to figure out which part of the business I was most interested in. Eventually I was able to boil
					my preferences down to three aspects:
					<ol>
						<li>I’ve always loved to act as a bridge between team departments and make sure everybody was working towards the same
							goal
						</li>
						<li>The way games communicate ideas and concepts to the player was always a major design priority in my eyes</li>
						<li>The roles I adopted in student projects were always related to both high level game design and programming</li>
					</ol>

								<h4>A Zen-Like Experience</h4>
								<br> The biggest difference of Aeronauts compared to traditional strategy games is the complete absence of militarized
								fights. There are enemy encounters on the dungeon-islands, but they are optional up to the point when you decide
								to engage.<br> This approach creates a very calm, <b>zen-like experience</b> that focuses solely on exploration and
								unit-management.
								<br>
								<br> One key component to achieve that goal is the resource tree which is inspired by the goods from <b>The Settlers II</b>.
								It is a relatively peaceful game when compared to major strategie competitors such as Age of Empires, Civilisation
								or the Anno series. The game feel is already pretty close to what we wanted to achieve for our game. However, the
								economy of the Settlers II is still <b>centered around the military</b> which is the driving force for everything.
								All the fortunes a player collects over the course of a game are spent to resolve military disputes. Gold coins which
								are used to recruit and train soldiers are the most expencive good. Unfortunately there is no civil equivalent to
								gold coins that is worth your time or resources.<br>
								<br>In Aeronauts <b>we wanted to take a different route:</b> Our resource tree is built around <b>cloth</b> which
								is substantial for everything else.
								<br>
								<br>

									alt=""><br>
									<br>You can collect wood, stone and single food pickups on the Main Island (the one where you start the
									game and build all your buildings) and survive for a couple of years. You should not be fooled though: You have
									to consume a sizebale amount of this deposit to build an air balloon that in turn enables you to venture an expedition
									to one of the neighbouring 'dungeon-islands'. These islands are rich of resources and your main supply source throughout
									the game.
									<br> The exploration of dungeon-islands naturally divides the game into 5-minute chunks of gameplay that are ideal
									for short mobile play-sessions.
									<br>
									<br>The flora and fauna of the dungeon-islands you encounter depends on the season during which you send off the
									expedition air-balloon. Granted you dispatch a balloon in the midst of Summer, you're most likely to encounter a
									sandy island full of palm trees and cactuses.

							<br> A little browser/Android prototype which was created during the 8-hour Grill and Game Jam 2016 at WERK1 in Munich.<br>
							<br> The jam's theme 'Fire & Flame' is a wordplay on the German figure of speech "Feuer und Flamme für etwas sein",
							which can be used whenever someone is really passionate.<br>
							<br> We took the theme quite literate and created a game in which you play a homeless person that is forced to burn
							his belongings to stay warm.
