							Hi,
							<br>
							<br>I’m a German game design student from Munich. I’ve been studying since summer 2015. Since then I had a shot at
							every aspect of game-making there is. Game design, programming, drawing, modeling, compositing, you name it…
							<br>It took me quite a while to figure out which part of the business I was most interested in. Eventually I was able
							to boil my preferences down to three aspects:
							<ol>
								<li>I’ve always loved to act as a bridge between team departments and make sure everybody was working towards the same
									goal
								</li>
								<li>The way games communicate ideas and concepts to the player was always a major design priority in my eyes</li>
								<li>The roles I adopted in student projects were always related to both high level game design and programming</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
